<h1>Hi, I'm Alberto!</h1>
I'm a double-degree student in Financial Modelling, splitting my time between Marseille, France, and Venice, Italy, as I work to complete my studies. In the meantime, I juggle Python scripts, financial theories, and the eternal question of how to pack for two climates! 🧳✈️
